## General Information
- **Project Objective:** This analysis aims to develop insights that can be used to predict whether a new loan applicant is likely to default.
- **Importance of EDA in Lending:** By leveraging data, financial institutions can gain valuable insights into customer behaviour, loan performance, and market trends, enabling them to make informed decisions.
- **Industry Challenges:** The lending industry is constantly evolving and faces numerous challenges such as increasing default rates and changing customer preferences. Understanding these challenges is essential for successful loan approval processes.
- **Company Context:** A consumer finance company is looking for patterns in customer and loan attributes that are associated with loan defaults. Identifying these patterns can improve loan approval decisions and mitigate risks.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
- **Data Collection:** Gathered loan and customer data from reliable sources.
- **Data Cleaning:** Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and corrected inconsistencies.
- **Data Transformation:** Converted categorical variables, normalized numerical data, and created new features where necessary.

## Analysis
- **Univariate Analysis:** Examined individual variables to understand their distributions and identify outliers.
- **Segmented Univariate Analysis:** Analyzed data segments to understand the behaviour of different customer groups.
- **Bivariate Analysis:** Explored relationships between pairs of variables to uncover correlations and potential causations.
- **Visualizations:** Created visual representations of data insights using Plotly and Matplotlib to better understand and communicate findings.

## Conclusions
- **Data Cleaning:** Efficiently and accurately cleaned the extracted data.
- **Insights from Univariate Analysis:** Identified key trends and outliers in individual variables.
- **Insights from Segmented Univariate Analysis:** Gained understanding of how different customer segments behave.
- **Insights from Bivariate Analysis:** Di
