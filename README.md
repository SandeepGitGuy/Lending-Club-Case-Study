## General Information
- Exploratory Data analysis plays a crucial role in Loan lending. By leveraging data, financial institutions can gain valuable insights into customer behavior, loan performance, and market trends, enabling them to make informed decisions.The goal of this analysis is to develop insights that can be used to predict whether a new loan applicant is likely to default.

- The lending industry is constantly evolving, facing numerous challenges such as increasing default rates and changing customer preferences. Understanding these challenges is essential for successful loan approval processes.

- A consumer finance company is looking for patterns in customer and loan attributes that are associated with loan defaults. By identifying these patterns, they can improve their loan approval decisions and mitigate risks.

## Conclusions
- We were able to efficiently and accurately clean data that were extract.
- We were able to perform Univariate and Segmented Univariate Analysis to find insights in the data.
- We were able to perform Bivariate to find insights in the data and to find relation betwwen data.
- We were able to find and analyse some of the driving factors for loan Defaults and also show the same in visual format.
